# ðŸ“œ MiniState â€“ State Control Made Easy

## Requirements for the MiniState Library

### Component-Centric Data Binding

**Purpose:** Each component is solely responsible for binding its own `data-*` attributes to specific DOM elements within its own component tree.

**Behavior:**
- The `wire` method is invoked exclusively within a component to bind a `data-*` attribute to a DOM property of another DOM element that is part of the same component's DOM subtree.
- No cross-component bindings are allowed; bindings are strictly encapsulated within individual components.
- We only wire inside components. We only wire component attributes that are part of the component's HTML DOM tree.

### Dynamic and Non-Hardcoded State Initialization

**Purpose:** Ensure flexibility and scalability by avoiding hardcoded state keys within the library.

**Behavior:**
- The `init` method dynamically initializes state based on the `data-*` attributes present in the DOM elements of each component.
- No hardcoded state keys; all state keys are derived programmatically from the component's `data-*` attributes.

### Separation of Concerns Between Components and State Management

**Purpose:** Maintain a clear boundary between UI components and the state management logic to enhance maintainability and scalability.

**Behavior:**
- Components do not handle asynchronous operations (e.g., data fetching) directly.
- All asynchronous operations are managed internally within the MiniState library in response to specific state change requests.

### Event-Driven Asynchronous Operations

**Purpose:** Trigger asynchronous operations declaratively in response to user interactions or other events.

**Behavior:**
- When a specific event occurs (e.g., a user clicks a button), the MiniState library handles the asynchronous operation (e.g., a Fetch API call) internally.
- The asynchronous operation is triggered by a state change request from the component, ensuring that all data fetching logic remains within the state management layer.

### Transactional State Changes with Predefined State Matching

**Purpose:** Ensure that state changes occur in a controlled, predictable manner that aligns with predefined application states.

**Behavior:**
- State changes are transactional, meaning they must match predefined states to be considered valid.
- Upon a valid state change request, the MiniState library updates the corresponding `data-*` attributes and, consequently, the bound DOM properties.
- No direct state mutations outside of these controlled transactions are permitted.

### Reactive State Watching Without Direct UI Updates

**Purpose:** Allow components to reactively respond to state changes without directly manipulating the UI.

**Behavior:**
- Components can watch specific state keys relevant to them.
- When a watched state changes, the component requests a state change to update its local state.
- Components do not directly update the UI; instead, they rely on the MiniState library to handle DOM updates based on state changes.
- We only watch inside components. We do not watch outside components.

### Internal Notification Mechanism for State Changes

**Purpose:** Facilitate communication between the state management layer and the components that depend on specific state keys.

**Behavior:**
- When a state change occurs, the MiniState library notifies all components that are watching the affected state keys.
- Components owning the watched state can then request further state changes as needed, maintaining a consistent and predictable flow of state transitions.
- We do not request local state changes outside components.

### No Direct UI Manipulation by Components

**Purpose:** Uphold the declarative nature of the state management paradigm by preventing components from directly altering the UI based on state changes.

**Behavior:**
- Components do not perform any direct DOM manipulations in response to state changes.
- All UI updates are automatically handled by the MiniState library based on the bound `data-*` attributes and their corresponding DOM properties.

### Scalability and Reusability

**Purpose:** Ensure that the MiniState library can accommodate an increasing number of components and state bindings without degradation in performance or maintainability.

**Behavior:**
- The architecture supports easy addition of new components and bindings.
- Minimal boilerplate code is required when integrating new components, promoting reusability.

### Robust Error Handling and User Feedback

**Purpose:** Provide clear and consistent feedback to users during asynchronous operations, especially in failure scenarios.

**Behavior:**
- The MiniState library manages error states and updates relevant `data-*` attributes to reflect error conditions.
- Components can watch error-related state keys to display appropriate error messages or fallback UI elements without embedding error handling logic within themselves.

### Cleanup Mechanisms for Watchers and Asynchronous Operations

**Purpose:** Prevent memory leaks and unintended side effects by managing the lifecycle of watchers and asynchronous operations.

**Behavior:**
- The MiniState library provides methods to unsubscribe watchers when components are unmounted or no longer need to observe certain state keys.
- Asynchronous operations can be canceled or cleaned up as necessary to maintain optimal performance.

### Consistent Naming Conventions for State Keys

**Purpose:** Enhance code readability and reduce the likelihood of errors in state key management.

**Behavior:**
- Adopt a standardized naming convention (e.g., camelCase or snake_case) for all state keys.
- State keys are derived consistently from component `data-*` attributes to ensure clarity and uniformity.

### MiniTemplate Components Best Practices

MiniTemplate's components are modular, with unique component IDs, scoped CSS, and collision-free JavaScript. Here's an example of how a component is structured, showcasing the best practices for performance and maintainability:

```html
<div id="button_default" class="btn" aria-label="Button Component">
    Click Me
    <script>
        // local state
        (() => {
            let clicked = false;
            document.getElementById('button_default').addEventListener('click', () => {
                clicked = !clicked;
                console.log('Button clicked:', clicked);
            });
        })();
    </script>
</div>
```
